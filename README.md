In our project, we aim to examine the impact of investor sentiments classified as 'buy' or 
'sell' tendencies through sentiment analysis of comments in investment forums on stock prices. 
By categorizing comments as positive, negative, or neutral, we aim to gauge investors' market 
expectations. In addition to sentiment analysis, we will also extract key terms to identify trending 
topics, apply topic modeling to classify major discussion themes (such as economic policies or 
sector-specific developments), and measure the intensity or confidence scores to understand the 
strength of investor opinions. We will further analyze the ratio of positive to negative comments 
on specific stocks and explore the social network structure of influential users whose opinions 
may impact stock price trends. Finally, we will analyze the relationship between these derived 
trends and stock prices using time-series and correlation analysis. Through this multifaceted NLP 
application, we intend to deepen our understanding and explore the potential predictive power of 
investor sentiment on market prices.
